While this receptor diversification strategy enables efficient immune responses against pathogens, it also poses a constant threat to the genome integrity. Tight regulation of this process at multiple levels is therefore critical to prevent genomic instability and neoplastic transformation. In this article, we discuss the temporal and spatial regulation of V(D)J recombination, in addition to the molecular mechanisms that regulate this process. Finally, we discuss the implication of V(D)J recombination in malignancies of the immune system.},

These proteins are responsible for sequence-specific DNA recognition and DNA cleavage, and they appear to perform multiple postcleavage roles in the reaction as well. Here we review the interaction of the RAG proteins with DNA, the chemistry of the cleavage reaction, and the higher order complexes in which these events take place. We also discuss postcleavage functions of the RAG proteins, including recent evidence indicating that they initiate the process of coding end processing by nicking hairpin DNA termini. Finally, we discuss the evolutionary and functional implications of the finding that RAG1 and RAG2 constitute a transposase, and we consider RAG protein biochemistry in the context of several bacterial transposition systems. This suggests a model of the RAG protein active site in which two divalent metal ions serve alternating and opposite roles as activators of attacking hydroxyl groups and stabilizers of oxyanion leaving groups. },

Analysis of recombination intermediates showed defects at the cleavage phase of the reaction. We also observed a reduction in overall recombinase activity in core-RAG2-expressing thymocytes, leading us to suggest that the interaction of a defective recombinase with RSS sequences unique to VH and V\ensuremath{\beta} gene segments may underlie the specific V-to-DJ rearrangement defect in core-RAG2 mice.},

	abstract = {During V(D)J recombination, RAG targeting to correct sites versus off-target sites relies on both DNA sequence features and on chromatin marks. Kinetic analysis using the first highly active full-length purified RAG1/RAG2 complexes has now allowed us to define the important catalytic features of this complex. We found that the overall rate of nicking, but not hairpinning, is critical for the discrimination between correct (optimal) versus off-target (suboptimal) sites used in human T-cell lymphomas, and we show that the C-terminal portion of RAG2 is required for this. This type of kinetic analysis permits us to analyze only the catalytically active RAG complex, in contrast to all other methods, which are unavoidably confounded by mixture with inactive RAG complexes. Moreover, we can distinguish the two major features of any enzymatic catalysis: the binding constant (KD) and the catalytic turnover rate, kcat. Beyond a minimal essential threshold of heptamer quality, further suboptimal heptamer deviations primarily reduce the catalytic rate constant kcat for nicking. Suboptimal nonamers reduce not only the binding of the RAG complex to the recombination site (KD) but also the catalytic rate constant, consistent with a tight interaction between the RAG complex and substrate during catalysis. These features explain many aspects of RAG physiology and pathophysiology.},

RAG1 has been shown to play a central role in DNA binding and catalysis. In contrast, the molecular roles of RAG2 in V(D)J recombination are unknown. To address this, we individually mutated 36 evolutionarily conserved basic and hydroxy group containing residues within RAG2. Biochemical analysis of the recombinant RAG2 proteins led to the identification of a number of basic residue mutants defective in catalysis in vitro and V(D)J recombination in vivo. Five of these were deficient in binding of the RAG1-RAG2 complex to its cognate DNA target sequence while interacting normally with RAG1.

	abstract = {Accessibility of antigen receptor gene segments to recombination-activating gene (RAG), the V(D)J recombinase, is correlated with marks of active chromatin. One mark, histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4me3), binds to a plant homeodomain (PHD) in the RAG-2 subunit; mutations that abolish binding of the PHD to H3K4me3 also impair V(D)J recombination. Engagement of H3K4me3 by RAG-2 enhances substrate binding and catalysis, which are functions of RAG-1. We show that H3K4me3 acts through the PHD to induce conformational changes in an autoinhibitory domain residing within RAG-2 as well as in substrate-binding and catalytic regions of RAG-1. Our data suggest that H3K4me3 promotes displacement of the autoinhibitory domain as well as concomitant conformational alterations in RAG-1 that favor increased substrate affinity and catalytic rate.V(D)J recombination is initiated by the recombination-activating gene (RAG) recombinase, consisting of RAG-1 and RAG-2 subunits. The susceptibility of gene segments to cleavage by RAG is associated with histone modifications characteristic of active chromatin, including trimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4me3). Binding of H3K4me3 by a plant homeodomain (PHD) in RAG-2 stimulates substrate binding and catalysis, which are functions of RAG-1. This has suggested an allosteric mechanism in which information regarding occupancy of the RAG-2 PHD is transmitted to RAG-1. To determine whether the conformational distribution of RAG is altered by H3K4me3, we mapped changes in solvent accessibility of cysteine thiols by differential isotopic chemical footprinting. Binding of H3K4me3 to the RAG-2 PHD induces conformational changes in RAG-1 within a DNA-binding domain and in the ZnH2 domain, which acts as a scaffold for the catalytic center. Thus, engagement of H3K4me3 by the RAG-2 PHD is associated with dynamic conformational changes in RAG-1, consistent with allosteric control by active chromatin.},
